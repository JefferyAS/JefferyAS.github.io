    <p>River is a one-button simulator game. There is a river and villagers living beside the river. Pressing the SPACE rises the water level of the river. The river evaporates by time, and evaporation speed is based on numbers of the suns on the sky. The goal of this game is to maintain a safe level of water so villagers can live and population can grow.</p>
